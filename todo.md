- [ ] <details><summary>Drawing ui class</summary>This class will handle the direct operation of writing to std::cout.</details>
- [ ] <details><summary>Main class</summary>A new class where the main loop will run, this should not have to deal with "low level" stuff, like opening files, and managing objects, or outputting directly to std::cout, those should be abstracted away.</details>
- [ ] <details><summary>Debug</summary>Since the code has never been fully tested, nor even compiled, this will take a while.</details>
- [ ] <details><summary>Prepare for unit tests</summary>Search for and download a possible unit test library, that actually works.</details>
- [ ] <details><summary>Write unit test</summary>Where ever possible of course, im not expecting to write unit tests, for data and parsefile.</details>
